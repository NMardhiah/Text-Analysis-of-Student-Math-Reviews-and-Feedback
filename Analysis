Text Analysis of Student Feedback on "Mathematics"

1. Primary Cognitive Goals: The "Understand" Factor
The Word Cloud and frequency data reveal that "understand" is one of the most prominent terms. This suggests that students are not merely looking for shortcuts or a passing grade; they are deeply concerned with conceptual clarity. This correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of "practice" and "exercises," indicating a recognition that mastery comes through repetitive application.

2. Sentiment Analysis: Scared but Motivated
The sentiment analysis results show a unique "Emotional Ambivalence." While the VADER scores lean positive overall due to phrases like "will try my best" and "excited to learn," the text analysis highlights a significant undercurrent of math anxiety.
Insights: Words like "scared," "traumatized," and "worried" often appear alongside mentions of "SPM" or "Addmaths," suggesting that student anxiety is rooted in past academic experiences rather than the current course content.

3. Dependency on Instructional Support
The prominence of the word "Dr" and "Lecturer" in the word cloud, combined with its high co-occurrence with "hope" and "help," signifies a high level of trust and dependency on the instructor. Students see the lecturer as the primary bridge to overcoming their perceived weaknesses in mathematics.


Recommendations 

1. Foundational Support: Since "Addmaths" and "SPM" are significant themes, a brief refresher on basic concepts at the start of the semester would likely lower the class anxiety.

2. Guided Practice: Because "understand" and "practice" are linked, providing step-by-step solutions or drills will satisfy the students' primary learning goals.

3.Emotional Reassurance: Acknowledging their "fear" openly can validate their feelings and strengthen the student-lecturer bond, which the data shows is very important to them.
