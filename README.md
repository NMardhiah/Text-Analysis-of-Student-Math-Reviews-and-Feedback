# Text-Analysis-of-Student-Math-Reviews-and-Feedback
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze how students review and discuss mathematical concepts. By extracting insights from text data, this research aims to bridge the gap between curriculum design and student perception.

The analysis is built on three primary pillars:
**Word Co-occurrence Analysis**: We move beyond simple word counts to examine the relationships between terms. By mapping how often specific math concepts (e.g., "Calculus") appear alongside descriptive adjectives (e.g., "abstract," "logical," "repetitive"), we can visualize the mental models students use.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Using polarity and subjectivity scoring, this project quantifies the emotional tone of reviews. This helps identify which specific topics in the math curriculum trigger the highest levels of "math anxiety" versus those that foster confidence.

**Visual Frequency Mapping (Word Clouds)**: To provide an immediate, intuitive summary of the dataset, we generate Word Clouds that highlight the most prominent themes and terminology used by students, filtered for mathematical relevance.
